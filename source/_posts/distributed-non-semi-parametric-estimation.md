# Divide-and-Conquer (or One-Shot) Methods

- @zhang2015divide, @lin2017distributed propose a method for nonparametric estimation by averaging local kernel ridge regression estimators.
- @zhao2016partially
- @lian2019projected (B-spline), @lv2022debiased (RKHS)
- @chen2022distributed investigate the use of the kernel-based Smoothed Maximum Score Estimator (SMSE) for solving semi-parametric binary response models.

# Communication-Efficient Methods
